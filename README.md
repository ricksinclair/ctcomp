# 🎨 ctcomp

`ctcomp` is a command-line utility for creating React components with TypeScript and SCSS modules quickly.

## 🎉 Getting Started

To use `ctcomp`, first install it globally:

```
npm install -g ctcomp

```

Then, you can use the `ctcomp` command to create a new component:

This will create a new directory called `MyComponent` in the current working directory, with a `MyComponent.tsx` file and a `MyComponent.module.scss` file.
